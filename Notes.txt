So a system unit is always the base unit for a given dimension. For
example the METRE is the system unit for km, in, ft, yd, etc. When
we get into ProductUnits like Newton for example. Newton could be
the system unit for Force where all other units of force convert
down to that. Of course FORCE is not a base dimension. But it is a
derived dimension.

So technically Base and Product units are my SystemUnits. There are
two types of AlternateUnits. The first is a conversion FACTOR and
the second is a SCALE. Bth ultimately get modeled as Transformed.

Conversion between Alternate ProductUnits will be much more complex
than conversion between your more common TransformedUnits.

A good example would be two FORCE Product Units

SI.NEWTON = METRE.multiply(KILO(GRAM)).divide(SECOND.pow(2))

CGS.DYNE = GRAM.multiply(CENTI(METRE).divide(SECOND.pow(2)))

When I can convert 1 Newton = 100000 Dyne, I have found success



System units are standardized:
Each measurement system (like the metric system or the imperial system)
has a set of base units (like meters, seconds, kilograms) that are
considered "system units" and are used as the foundation for all other
units within that system.

Transformation creates new units:
When you transform a unit by multiplying or dividing it with another
unit, you are essentially creating a new unit that isn't explicitly
defined within the system, making it a "transformed unit".


Example
System unit: "meter" (m) - a standard unit of length in the metric
system.

Transformed unit: "meters per second" (m/s) - this unit is created
by dividing meters by seconds, which is useful for measuring speed
but isn't a predefined unit within the metric system.
