Units created from Prefix like KILO(GRAM) do not output a traditional symbol.
For example the above .getSymbol() => kg

Somehow the prefix symbol needs to be carried forward to the new unit so that
we can prefix the base unit's symbol.

----------------------------

So rework AlternateUnit as it should always reflect an Alternate type of unit
within a domain. For example within the Length domain Feet, Yard, Inch are
alternative units from the BaseUnit of METRE.

A Prefixed unit like KILO(METRE) should be classified as an Alternate Unit as
it is in the same domain just a different multiple.

NEWTON = METRE.multiply(KILO(GRAM)).divide(SECOND.pow(2) is NOT an Alternate
unit but a derived unit. In my world derived units are Transformed or
ProductUnits.

When it comes to derived units it would be nice if the symbols where stitched
together.

I should validate this but I suspect that almost ALL transformed units would
be AlternateUnits as defined above. And from the UCUM impl they do in fact
appear to be.

----------------------------

SystemUnit and BaseUnit are virtually the same. So what is the system unit for
say Force? Is that a ProductUnit which is a composition of METRE, GRAM, and
SECOND?

----------------------------

I would like to have a utility method on ProductUnit that makes it easy to give
it a name, symbol, and even type cast it to a particular quantity TYPE.

Additionally, if not overridden it would be nice if the Product Unit derived its
unit symbol from the input unit symbols. For example Newton in known as N but it
 is also kg*m/s2.. The later could be derived from
        METRE.multiply(KILO(GRAM)).divide(SECOND.pow(2)).

----------------------------

Many units are named with their Type. For example
  SCRUPLE_APOTHECARY Exists inside a Class of TYPE Apothecaries

would it make more sense to fully qualify it as
  Apothecaries.SCRUPLE
to help delineate between similarly named items?

----------------------------

Lots of UCUM units which do have symbols not actually defining
them
