Units created from Prefix like KILO(GRAM) do not output a traditional symbol.
For example the above .getSymbol() => kg

Somehow the prefix symbol needs to be carried forward to the new unit so that
we can prefix the base unit's symbol.

----------------------------

I cannot use Prefixed Units in AlternateUnit. Is that a real need or is it
just conceptual?

Quantity
  Absement - SI
  AreaDensity - SI
  Density - None
  Impulse - SI
  Level - UCUM (decibel)
  LuminousEfficacy - SI
  Momentum - SI
  RadiationDoseAbsorbedRate - SI

UCUM Units
  Chemical
  Clinical Medicine is only partially implemented
  Levels

----------------------------

Many units are named with their Type. For example
  SCRUPLE_APOTHECARY Exists inside a Class of TYPE Apothecaries

would it make more sense to fully qualify it as
  Apothecaries.SCRUPLE
to help delineate between similarly named items?

----------------------------

Lots of UCUM units which do have symbols not actually defining
them
