/**
 * Electrical resistivity (also called specific electrical resistance or volume
 * resistivity) is a fundamental property of a material that measures how strongly
 * it resists electric current. Its inverse, called electrical conductivity,
 * quantifies how well a material conducts electricity. The system unit for this
 * quantity is "Ω⋅m" (ohm metre).
